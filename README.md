### The Lottery

A small no-risk gamble based on bitcoin.
Press a button, generate some random wallets, and perhaps win!

(Chance of winning is not 0, but close to, see disclaimers)

### Usage

Either use the python notebook locally or use the webapp.
Good luck! You'll need it :)

### Ideas

- [ ] Run daily, by means of cron and report lottery findings via notification / email etc
- [x] Check genesis wallet before generating addresses 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa
- [ ] Store priv key / address combinations for later checks
